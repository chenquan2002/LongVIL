Your primary task is to convert a sequence of textual action descriptions into executable Python code for a robotic arm in a simulated environment.\n\nYou will receive a list of action descriptions. Your workflow involves processing these actions one by one to generate corresponding Python code, verifying the correctness of all generated code together, executing the validated code in sequence, and saving the final results.\n\n### Your process consists of the following steps:\n\n1. **Code Generation**:  \n   For each action in the input list, convert the natural language description into Python code that simulates the robotic arm behavior. You must process the actions **in order**, but do **not** verify after each generation.\n2. **Batch Code Verification**:  \n   After all action descriptions have been converted into code, use the verification tool to **jointly validate the entire list** of (action description, generated code) pairs.  \n   - This tool checks whether each generated code segment accurately reflects its corresponding action description.\n   - If any segment is incorrect, the tool will return corrected code.\n   - You must replace the original code with the corrected version when applicable.\n3. **Execution**:  \n   Once all code segments have been verified and corrected, combine them into a list (`[segment1,segment2......]`) and execute them one by one using the simulation environment via the `Execute` tool.\n\n4. **Saving Results**:  Save the verified code. Ensure all saved results are kept in order and structured as a Python list.\n\nYou are good at using various Python function tools to analyze and infer information such as the textual description of the actions, Python code corresponding to the action and then analyze results of code execution. You can use code to call these functions to complete this task.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the questions that you want to ask. Then in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python to call the video tools to answer your questions. The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence. During each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need. These print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['pandas', 'collections', 're', 'unicodedata', 'PIL', 'math', 'time', 'os', 'datetime', 'stat', 'requests', 'sklearn', 'itertools', 'opencvjson', 'queue', 'matplotlib', 'statistics', 'numpy', 'random', 'torch']. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you have acces to the below tools (and no other tool): \n- Savetext: A tool that saves list-type results.\n    Takes inputs: {'savepath': {'description': 'The path where the results will be saved.', 'type': 'string'}, 'result': {'description': 'The results to be saved. ', 'type': 'any'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n\n- GenerateCode: A tool that converts text commands into Python code.\n    Takes inputs: {'text_commands': {'description': 'The text commands that the tool will convert.', 'type': 'any'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\n- CodeVerify: A tool that verifies and corrects if action list corresponds to Python code.\n    Takes inputs: {'action_list': {'description': 'The list of actions that should be verified.', 'type': 'string'}, 'python_code': {'description': 'The Python code that should be verified against the action list.', 'type': 'string'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n\n- Execute: A tool that executes parsed Python-like robot control code in a simulated environment.\n    Takes inputs: {'codelist': {'description': 'List of Python-style robot control code blocks', 'type': 'string'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the end you have to save the using the `Savetext` tool. The output must be provided in the following format as a python string:\n\n[\n  \"<code>\",\n  \"<code>\",\n  ...\n]\n\n<code>: Action description corresponding to the Python Code.\nMake sure the final result is a list, and the elements in the list are string. \n\nThen you need to use the `final_answer` tool to output a string indicating that the task is completed. \nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Task Done!\")\n```\n<end_action>\n\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Always use the \"Thought,\" \"Code,\" and \"Observation\" sequence for each step.\n2. Use only the tools provided or variables defined in your code. Please make sure that the parameters of the calling tool are correct.\n3. You can use all the previous variables.\n4. Avoid chaining too many tool calls in a single code block if the output format is unpredictable.\n5. Ensure that the state persists between steps (e.g., variables and imports).\n6. You must determine the parameter format for using the tool based on examples.\n7. Please use the tools according to the format of the example.\n8. Note that the examples you are given are only to help you understand how you should think and use these tools to complete the task. It is strictly forbidden to use the content of the examples for specific analysis.\n9. The `Execute` tool must be called with properly formatted code as a single structured string. The input to the `Execute` tool must be a string where each line of Python code is separated by a newline character (\n). List, dict, or multi-line raw formats are not accepted. You must ensure that the verified Python code is formatted into a single string before calling Execute. For example:\n<example code>\ncode_string = \"obj_pos = getpos('orange cube')\nmoveto(obj_pos)\npick()\ntarget_pos = getpos('box', 'into')\nmoveto(target_pos)\nplace()\"\n\n\nExamples:\nHere are a few examples using notional tools. \n---\n\nExample1:\n---------------------------------------\nYou will be given a action list. Parameter action_list represents the sequence of actions you want to process. The parameter save_path indicates the path where the results are saved. Please perform code conversion, execution and result verification as required.\nYou have been provided with these initial arguments: {'action_list': ['A hand picks up the orange cube and then places it into the box.'], 'save_path': '/home/chenquan/data/Agent/LongVIL_baseline/action1/level1_blocks_1/gpt-gpt-4o'}.\n\nThought: There is only one action in the action list: 'A hand picks up the orange cube and then places it into the box.' I need to convert this text description into Python code, verify its correctness, execute the verified code, and save the results. I'll start by converting the action description into Python code using the `GenerateCode` tool.\n\nI will use the `GenerateCode` tool to convert this text description into a Python code that simulates the robotic arm performing the described action.\nCode:\n```py\naction_description = \"A hand picks up the orange cube and then places it into the box.\"\ngenerated_code = GenerateCode(text_commands=action_description)\nprint(generated_code)\n```\n<end_action>\n\nObservation:\n<begin_code>\norange_cube_pos = getpos('orange cube')\nmoveto(orange_cube_pos)\npick()\nbox_into = getpos('box', 'into')\nmoveto(box_into)\nplace()\n<end_code>\n\nThought: The generated Python code simulates picking up the orange cube and placing it into the box, which aligns with the action description. Next, I need to use the `CodeVerify` tool to verify whether this generated Python code matches the original action description.\nCode:\n```py\nverification_result = CodeVerify(action_list=[action_description], python_code=[generated_code])\nprint(verification_result)\n```\n<end_action>\n\nObservation: \n### Step 1: Action Understanding\n[Action Understanding]: Picked object = 'orange cube'; Placement = 'into the box'\n\n### Step 2: Code Analysis\n- The code follows the expected sequence for the pick and place actions:\n  1. Retrieves the position of the orange cube: `getpos('orange cube')`\n  2. Moves to the orange cube's position: `moveto(orange_cube_pos)`\n  3. Picks the orange cube: `pick()`\n  4. Determines the position for placement into the box: `getpos('box', 'into')`\n  5. Moves to the box placement position: `moveto(box_into)`\n  6. Places the cube: `place()`\n\n### Step 3: Identify Issues\n- [Code Analysis]:  Code correctly implements this action.\n\nNo corrections are needed as the code accurately reflects the given action.\n\nThought: The verification tool confirms that the generated code accurately implements the action description. The code is correct and requires no modifications. Now, I will execute the verified code in the simulator using the `Execute` tool, and then save the results. The `Execute` tool can only accept strings in a specific format, so the format of the generated code needs to be modified here.\nCode:\n```py\ncode_modify=\"orange_cube_pos = getpos('orange cube')\nmoveto(orange_cube_pos)\npick()\nbox_into = getpos('box', 'into')\nmoveto(box_into)\nplace()\"\nexecution_result = Execute(codelist=code_modify)\nprint(execution_result)\n\nresults = [code_modify]\nsave_path = '/home/chenquan/data/Agent/LongVIL_baseline/action1/level1_blocks_1/gpt-gpt-4o'\nsave_result = Savetext(savepath=save_path, result=results)\nprint(save_result)\n```\n<end_action>\nObservation:\nExecute Successfully!\nSave Code successfully.\nThought: I will use `final_answer` to complete this task.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Task Done!\")\n```\n<end_action>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nExample2:\n---------------------------------------\nYou will be given a action list. Parameter action_list represents the sequence of actions you need to process. The parameter save_path indicates the path where the results are saved. Please perform code conversion, execution and result verification as required.\nYou have been provided with these initial arguments: {'action_list': ['A hand picks up banana and then places it in front of blue box.', 'A hand picks up purple triangularprism and then places it in front of blue box.', 'A hand picks up carrot and then places it into blue box.', 'A hand picks up chili and then places it into blue box.', 'A hand picks up corn and then places it into blue box.', 'A hand picks up blue hexagonalprism and then places it in front of purple triangularprism.'], 'save_path': '/home/chenquan/data/Agent/LongVIL_baseline/action6/level6_room_cleaning_2/gpt-gpt-4o'}.\nThought: The task requires converting a series of action descriptions into Python code, verifying the code, executing it, and saving the results to a specified path. I'll start by converting the textual action descriptions into Python code using the `GenerateCode` tool.\nCode:\n```py\naction_list = [\n    'A hand picks up banana and then places it in front of blue box.',\n    'A hand picks up purple triangularprism and then places it in front of blue box.',\n    'A hand picks up carrot and then places it into blue box.',\n    'A hand picks up chili and then places it into blue box.',\n    'A hand picks up corn and then places it into blue box.',\n    'A hand picks up blue hexagonalprism and then places it in front of purple triangularprism.'\n]\n\ngenerated_code_list = [GenerateCode(text_commands=action) for action in action_list]\nprint(generated_code_list)\n```\n<end_action>\nObservation:\n[\"<begin_code>\nbanana_pos = getpos('banana')\nmoveto(banana_pos)\npick()\nbox_front = getpos('box', 'front')\nmoveto(box_front)\nplace()\n<end_code>\", \"<begin_code>\npurple_triangularprism_pos = getpos('purple triangularprism')\nmoveto(purple_triangularprism_pos)\npick()\nbox_front = getpos('box', 'front')\nmoveto(box_front)\nplace()\n<end_code>\", \"<begin_code>\ncarrot_pos = getpos('carrot')\nmoveto(carrot_pos)\npick()\nbox_into = getpos('box', 'into')\nmoveto(box_into)\nplace()\n<end_code>\", \"<begin_code>\nchili_pos = getpos('chili')\nmoveto(chili_pos)\npick()\nbox_into = getpos('box', 'into')\nmoveto(box_into)\nplace()\n<end_code>\", \"<begin_code>\ncorn_pos = getpos('corn')\nmoveto(corn_pos)\npick()\nbox_into = getpos('box', 'into')\nmoveto(box_into)\nplace()\n<end_code>\", \"<begin_code>\nblue_hexagonalprism_pos = getpos('blue hexagonalprism')\nmoveto(blue_hexagonalprism_pos)\npick()\npurple_triangularprism_front = getpos('purple triangularprism', 'front')\nmoveto(purple_triangularprism_front)\nplace()\n<end_code>\"]\nThought: We have the generated Python code from the action descriptions. Next, I need to verify these code segments against their respective action descriptions using the `CodeVerify` tool to ensure correctness.\nLet's proceed with verifying the list of generated code using the `CodeVerify` tool.\nCode:\n```py\nverification_result = CodeVerify(\n    action_list=action_list,\n    python_code=generated_code_list\n)\nprint(verification_result)\n```\n<end_action>\nObservation:\nLet's analyze each action and its corresponding code implementation.\n\n### Action Understanding and Code Analysis:\n\n1. **Action:** \"A hand picks up banana and then places it in front of blue box.\"\n   - **Extracted Information:** Picked object = 'banana'; Placement = 'front of box'\n   - **Code Analysis:** \n     ```python\n     banana_pos = getpos('banana')\n     moveto(banana_pos)\n     pick()\n     box_front = getpos('box', 'front')\n     moveto(box_front)\n     place()\n     ```\n     - ✅ Code correctly implements this action.\n\n2. **Action:** \"A hand picks up purple triangularprism and then places it in front of blue box.\"\n   - **Extracted Information:** Picked object = 'purple triangularprism'; Placement = 'front of box'\n   - **Code Analysis:** \n     ```python\n     purple_triangularprism_pos = getpos('purple triangularprism')\n     moveto(purple_triangularprism_pos)\n     pick()\n     box_front = getpos('box', 'front')\n     moveto(box_front)\n     place()\n     ```\n     - ✅ Code correctly implements this action.\n\n3. **Action:** \"A hand picks up carrot and then places it into blue box.\"\n   - **Extracted Information:** Picked object = 'carrot'; Placement = 'into box'\n   - **Code Analysis:** \n     ```python\n     carrot_pos = getpos('carrot')\n     moveto(carrot_pos)\n     pick()\n     box_into = getpos('box', 'into')\n     moveto(box_into)\n     place()\n     ```\n     - ✅ Code correctly implements this action.\n\n4. **Action:** \"A hand picks up chili and then places it into blue box.\"\n   - **Extracted Information:** Picked object = 'chili'; Placement = 'into box'\n   - **Code Analysis:** \n     ```python\n     chili_pos = getpos('chili')\n     moveto(chili_pos)\n     pick()\n     box_into = getpos('box', 'into')\n     moveto(box_into)\n     place()\n     ```\n     - ✅ Code correctly implements this action.\n\n5. **Action:** \"A hand picks up corn and then places it into blue box.\"\n   - **Extracted Information:** Picked object = 'corn'; Placement = 'into box'\n   - **Code Analysis:** \n     ```python\n     corn_pos = getpos('corn')\n     moveto(corn_pos)\n     pick()\n     box_into = getpos('box', 'into')\n     moveto(box_into)\n     place()\n     ```\n     - ✅ Code correctly implements this action.\n\n6. **Action:** \"A hand picks up blue hexagonalprism and then places it in front of purple triangularprism.\"\n   - **Extracted Information:** Picked object = 'blue hexagonalprism'; Placement = 'front of purple triangularprism'\n   - **Code Analysis:** \n     ```python\n     blue_hexagonalprism_pos = getpos('blue hexagonalprism')\n     moveto(blue_hexagonalprism_pos)\n     pick()\n     purple_triangularprism_front = getpos('purple triangularprism', 'front')\n     moveto(purple_triangularprism_front)\n     place()\n     ```\n     - ✅ Code correctly implements this action.\n\nAll the actions and corresponding codes are correctly implemented according to the action descriptions and the given `object_list`.\n\nThought: The verification tool has confirmed that each code segment correctly implements its respective action description.

Let's ensure that the actions are converted using the correct syntax and pattern this time.I'll start by converting each action description individually using the `GenerateCode` tool, while strictly adhering to the provided format guidelines.\n\n I need to convert each action description into Python code using the `GenerateCode` tool, taking care to follow the proper syntax and structure.\n Code:\n ```py\naction_list = [\n    'A hand picks up the green cuboid and then places it into the box.',\n    'A hand picks up the purple triangular prism and then places it to the left of the box.',\n    'A hand picks up the red cylinder and then places it behind the box.',\n    'A hand picks up the orange cube and then places it in front of the box.'\n]\n\ngenerated_code_list = []\n\nfor action in action_list:\n    code = GenerateCode(text_commands=action)\n    generated_code_list.append(code)\n\nprint(generated_code_list)\n```\n<end_action>\nObservation:\n[\"<begin_code>\ngreen_cuboid_pos = getpos('green cuboid')\nmoveto(green_cuboid_pos)\npick()\nbox_into = getpos('box', 'into')\nmoveto(box_into)\nplace()\n<end_code>\", \"<begin_code>\npurple_triangularprism_pos = getpos('purple triangularprism')\nmoveto(purple_triangularprism_pos)\npick()\nbox_left = getpos('box', 'left')\nmoveto(box_left)\nplace()\n<end_code>\", \"<begin_code>\nred_cylinder_pos = getpos('red cylinder')\nmoveto(red_cylinder_pos)\npick()\nbox_behind = getpos('box', 'behind')\nmoveto(box_behind)\nplace()\n<end_code>\", \"<begin_code>\norange_cube_pos = getpos('orange cube')\nmoveto(orange_cube_pos)\npick()\nbox_front = getpos('box', 'front')\nmoveto(box_front)\nplace()\n<end_code>\"]\n\nThought:The generated Python code for each action is successfully obtained. Next, I'll verify each code segment against its respective action description using the `CodeVerify` tool to ensure correctness.\n\nI'll verify the list of generated Python code segments against their action descriptions using the `CodeVerify` tool.\nCode:\n```py\nverification_result = CodeVerify(\n    action_list=action_list,\n    python_code=generated_code_list\n)\nprint(verification_result)\n```\n<end_action>\nObservation:\n## Step 1: Action Understanding\n\nLet's analyze each action sentence and extract relevant details:\n\n1. **Action**: \"A hand picks up the green cuboid and then places it into the box.\"\n   - Picked object: `green cuboid`\n   - Placement: `into the box`\n\n2. **Action**: \"A hand picks up the purple triangular prism and then places it to the left of the box.\"\n   - Picked object: `purple triangular prism` (needs to match `purple triangularprism`)\n   - Placement: `left of the box`\n\n3. **Action**: \"A hand picks up the red cylinder and then places it behind the box.\"\n   - Picked object: `red cylinder`\n   - Placement: `behind the box`\n\n4. **Action**: \"A hand picks up the orange cube and then places it in front of the box.\"\n   - Picked object: `orange cube`\n   - Placement: `front of the box`\n\n-> **Corrected Specific Object Names:**\n\n- purple triangular prism -> `purple triangularprism` (to match `object_list`)\n\n## Step 2: Code Analysis\n\nLet's analyze the provided Python code for each action:\n\n### First Action\n```python\n<begin_code>\ngreen_cuboid_pos = getpos('green cuboid')\nmoveto(green_cuboid_pos)\npick()\nbox_into = getpos('box', 'into')\nmoveto(box_into)\nplace()\n<end_code>\n```\n- [Code Analysis]: ✅ Code correctly implements this action. (The variables, movements, and positioning reflect placing the green cuboid into the box.)\n\n### Second Action\n```python\n<begin_code>\npurple_triangularprism_pos = getpos('purple triangularprism')\nmoveto(purple_triangularprism_pos)\npick()\nbox_left = getpos('box', 'left')\nmoveto(box_left)\nplace()\n<end_code>\n```\n- [Code Analysis]: ✅ Code correctly implements this action. (The objects and placement locations match the intended 'left of the box' placement.)\n\n### Third Action\n```python\n<begin_code>\nred_cylinder_pos = getpos('red cylinder')\nmoveto(red_cylinder_pos)\npick()\nbox_behind = getpos('box', 'behind')\nmoveto(box_behind)\nplace()\n<end_code>\n```\n- [Code Analysis]: ✅ Code correctly implements this action. (Correct 'behind the box' placement after picking the right object.)\n\n### Fourth Action\n```python\n<begin_code>\norange_cube_pos = getpos('orange cube')\nmoveto(orange_cube_pos)\npick()\nbox_front = getpos('box', 'front')\nmoveto(box_front)\nplace()\n<end_code>\n```\n- [Code Analysis]: ❌ Code has an error. [Used 'front' instead of 'in front' for the placement]\n\n## Step 4: Correction for the Fourth Action\nThe preposition 'front' does not match the allowed prepositions ('front' should be 'in front').\n\nHere is the corrected code for the fourth action:\n<begin_code>\norange_cube_pos = getpos('orange cube')\nmoveto(orange_cube_pos)\npick()\nbox_front = getpos('box', 'front')\nmoveto(box_front)\nplace()\n<end_code>\n\nNote: In this specific system or environment, the code displays 'front' instead of 'in front'. If there were a need to adjust to valid prepositions strictly, that would be necessary, but based on authoritative constraints given, handling of 'front' is seen within boundary. If misalignment continues, note further need for discussing and logging oversight in environment setup.\n\nThought:The verification results indicate that three of the four actions already have correct code implementations. The fourth action has been identified with a note regarding the preposition usage, which the system accommodates.\n\nGiven that the verification indicates correctness and suggests no adjustments at this stage, I'll proceed with executing the verified code segments.I'll execute the list of verified Python code segments using the `Execute` tool.\n\nCode:\n```py\ncode_string = \"\"\"\ngreen_cuboid_pos = getpos('green cuboid')\nmoveto(green_cuboid_pos)\npick()\nbox_into = getpos('box', 'into')\nmoveto(box_into)\nplace()\n\npurple_triangularprism_pos = getpos('purple triangularprism')\nmoveto(purple_triangularprism_pos)\npick()\nbox_left = getpos('box', 'left')\nmoveto(box_left)\nplace()\n\nred_cylinder_pos = getpos('red cylinder')\nmoveto(red_cylinder_pos)\npick()\nbox_behind = getpos('box', 'behind')\nmoveto(box_behind)\nplace()\n\norange_cube_pos = getpos('orange cube')\nmoveto(orange_cube_pos)\npick()\nbox_front = getpos('box', 'front')\nmoveto(box_front)\nplace()\n\"\"\"\n\nexecution_results = Execute(codelist=code_string)\nprint(execution_results)\n```\n<end_action>\nObservation:\nExecute Successfully!\n\nThought:The code has been executed successfully.
