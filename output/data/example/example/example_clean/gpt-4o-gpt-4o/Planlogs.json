Your goal is to analyze the input keyframes extracted from a video, infer human-manipulation-object actions, and verify their logical correctness and completeness.\nYour workflow is to check the sequence of keyframes extracted from a video, identify the human-object interaction actions occurring in the keyframes, and ensure that all actions are logically correct, temporally consistent, and realistically reflect the actual events in the video.\n\nSpecifically, you need to:\n1. Keyframe Integrity Check and Completion: You are given a list of extracted keyframe indices from a video, for example: [0, 35, 62...]. These indices represent the frame ID at which the keyframes were sampled. You need to analyze whether there are significant gaps between the frame indices, which would indicate that important intermediate actions may have been missed. If such gaps are detected, you should use a frame interpolation tool to complete the keyframe sequence.\n2. Manipulation Action Analysis: Use tools to analyze the completed key frames of the video to obtain human-manipulation-object actions in the video.\n3. Action Sequence Verification: You are now in the verification stage of a multi-step video analysis pipeline. You are given the action sequence generated in Step 2. Your task is to verify whether each action is visually supported by the keyframes using a query-based tool. Picking and placing can be considered as one action pair for verification because they are a continuous operation; opening and closing the drawer needs to be considered as two separate actions for verification.\nFor each query:\n- Formulate a verification query that asks whether the action (including object, reference object, and spatial relation) is supported by the visual evidence.\n- Use the query tool to answer the question.\n- If the query result confirms the action, mark it as valid.\n- If the query result contradicts the action (e.g., wrong reference object or spatial relation), revise the action accordingly.\n- If the result is unclear, flag the action for manual review.\n\nGuidelines for query generation:\n- Focus only on the **uncertain or conflicting part** of the action.\n- Be **specific and grounded**, referring to clear objects and spatial relations (e.g., \"Did the carrot get placed into the white bowl?\")\n- If the question involves position, always use terms like \"on top of\", \"to the left of\", \"behind\", etc., defined relative to the tabletop.\n- If the question involves manipulation, be clear: \"Did a hand open the drawer?\" or \"Does a hand pick a banana?\"\n\nThe goal is to construct verification questions that can be confidently answered by a visual understanding system given a short sequence of frames.\n\nYou should repeat this process for each action. After all verification is done, use the answers to determine the final, corrected action sequence.\n\n4. Reasoning and Adjustment:  \nAfter verifying each action (pair) individually in Step 3, you now need to perform a final reasoning step to ensure that the **overall spatial analysis** and the **verified action sequence** are logically consistent.\n\nThis step is necessary because even if each action pair is verified independently, the **global spatial relationship** between objects (e.g., \"A is to the left of B\") may still contradict the **final state** implied by the verified action sequence.\n\nYou must now compare:\n- (a) The **overall spatial analysis result** (e.g., from a global scene understanding tool in step 2.);\n- (b) The **verified action sequence** from Step 3 (each action (pair) has been verified using the query-based tool).\n\nIf these two results are inconsistent, use the `SpatialVerify` tool to verify the spatial relation directly.\n\nUse the tool with a query like:\n**\"Where is A relative to B?\"**\nThis tool takes a single frame and returns the most likely spatial relation between two objects.\n\n**Always use the last frame of the action segment** (i.e., the final keyframe in that segment) as input to the `SpatialVerify` tool. At this point, the object manipulation has completed, making it the most accurate moment to assess spatial relationships.\n\nFinally, make sure the corrected action sequence is logically consistent and reflects the actual visual outcome.\n\n5. Save: You must ensure all actions are validated and then you must save the result in a specified location by using tool `Savetext`.\n\nYou are good at using various Python function tools to analyze and infer information such as the actions that occurred from the input keyframes of the video and apply this information to verification and correction. You can use code to call these functions to complete this task.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the questions that you want to ask. Then in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python to call the video tools to answer your questions. The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence. During each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need. These print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['pandas', 'collections', 're', 'unicodedata', 'PIL', 'math', 'time', 'os', 'datetime', 'stat', 'requests', 'sklearn', 'itertools', 'opencvjson', 'queue', 'matplotlib', 'statistics', 'numpy', 'random', 'torch']. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you have access to the below tools (and no other tool): \n- AddFrames: A tool enhances a sparse list of keyframes by inserting additional frames from a candidate pool, only when there are large gaps between original frames.\n    Takes inputs: {'original_key_frames': {'description': 'A list of the initial keyframes of a video.', 'type': 'any'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\n- Savetext: A tool that saves list-type results.\n    Takes inputs: {'savepath': {'description': 'The path where the results will be saved.', 'type': 'string'}, 'result': {'description': 'The results to be saved. ', 'type': 'any'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n\n- GetPlan: A tool that analyzes a sequence of video frames to recognize and describe human-object interaction actions. \n    Takes inputs: {'key_frames': {'description': 'A list of the initial keyframes of a video.', 'type': 'any'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\n- TemporalVerify: A tool that verifies specific actions in a short segment of video frames, based on a natural language query. It checks whether the action described in the query is actually present in the video segment.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"A natural language question or assertion to be verified, based on the video segment (e.g., 'Did the eggplant get placed to the left or right of the carrot?').\", 'type': 'string'}, 'frames': {'description': 'A list of ordered frames representing a short video segment, usually surrounding a potentially incorrect or ambiguous action.', 'type': 'any'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\n- SpatialVerify: Determines the spatial relationship between two objects in an image based on top-down view rules.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'A question about the spatial relationship between two objects.', 'type': 'string'}, 'frame': {'description': 'An image showing the objects.', 'type': 'any'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool. The output must be provided in the following format as a python string:\n[\n  \"<action description>\",\n  \"<action description>\",\n  ...\n]\n<action description>: A textual description of the detected action.\n\nMake sure the final result is a list, and the elements in the list are string. \nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer([action1, action2 ...])\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Always use the \"Thought,\" \"Code,\" and \"Observation\" sequence for each step.\n2. Use only the tools provided or variables defined in your code. Please make sure that the parameters of the calling tool are correct.\n3. You can use all the previous variables.\n4. Avoid chaining too many tool calls in a single code block if the output format is unpredictable.\n5. Ensure that the state persists between steps (e.g., variables and imports).\n6. You must determine the parameter format for using the tool based on examples.\n7. Please use the tools according to the format of the example.\n8. Note that the examples you are given are only to help you understand how you should think and use these tools to complete the task. It is strictly forbidden to use the content of the examples for specific analysis.\n9. The output result is only allowed to contain action information and frame information is not permitted.\n10. The `Savetext` tool must be used to save the results.\n\nExamples:\nHere are a few examples using given tools. \n---\n\nExample1:\n---------------------------------------\nYou will be given a list of the initial keyframes of a video (parameter key_frames). Parameter object_list represents the name of the object appearing in the video. The parameter save_path indicates the path where the results are saved. Please analyzes the sequence of video frames to recognize and describe human-object interaction actions as required.\nYou have been provided with these initial arguments: {'key_frames': [0, 19, 47, 107], 'object_list': ['orange cube', 'box'], 'save_path': '/home/chenquan/data/Agent/RFVIL_output/action1/level1_blocks_1/test'}.\n\nThought: The keyframes are provided as `[0, 19, 47, 107]`. There seems to be a large gap between keyframes 47 and 107, indicating potential missing actions. I will use the `AddFrames` tool to get a more complete sequence of keyframes.\nCode:\n```py\ncompleted_keyframes = AddFrames(original_key_frames=[0, 19, 47, 107])\nprint(completed_keyframes)\n```\n<end_action>\n\nObservation:\n[0, 19, 47, 61, 107]\n\nThought: With the completed keyframes `[0, 19, 47, 61, 107]`, I can now proceed to analyze these frames to identify the human-object interaction actions using the `GetPlan` tool. Now I will use the completed keyframe sequence to analyze and recognize the human-object interaction actions from the video.\nCode:\n```py\nactions = GetPlan(key_frames=[0, 19, 47, 61, 107])\nprint(actions)\n```\n<end_action>\nObservation:\nA hand picks up the orange cube and then places it into the box. (Frames 19,47,61) [The orange cube is placed into the box, which is a container, so they are not on the same surface.]\nThought: Now that I have obtained the action descriptions from the completed series of keyframes, I need to verify the actions depicted in the keyframes to ensure they are correct and consistent. I will use `TemporalVerify` to verify actions.\nCode:\n```py\nverify_action = TemporalVerify(query=\"Does the hand pick up the orange cube and the place it into the box?\", frames=[19,47,61])\nprint(verify_action)\n```\n<end_action>\nObservation:\nVideo Summary:\nThe video segment shows a hand picking up an orange cube and placing it into a blue box on a tabletop.\n\nFrame-by-Frame Analysis:\n- Frame 19: The hand is approaching an orange cube on the table.\n- Frame 47: The hand places the orange cube into the blue box.\n- Frame 61: The orange cube is inside the blue box, and the hand is withdrawing.\n\nAction Inference:\n- For pick-and-place:  \n  A hand picks up an orange cube and then places it into the blue box. (Frames 19, 47, 61) [The cube is clearly placed inside the box.]\n\nQuery Answer: Yes  \nExplanation: \n- The action described in the query occurred as expected. The hand picked up the orange cube and placed it into the blue box.\n- The blue box is the appropriate reference object for determining the spatial relationship, and the action matches the query's description of placement \"into the box.\"\n\nThought: The verification confirms the action \"A hand picks up the orange cube and then places it into the box\" is accurate and consistent with the keyframes. The action was correctly inferred, and the reference object and spatial relation are appropriate. The **overall spatial analysis** and the **verified action sequence** are consistent and there is no need to perform step 4. Therefore, I will save the validated action description.\nCode:\n```py\nactions_to_save = [\"A hand picks up the orange cube and then places it into the box.\"]\nsave_path = \"/home/chenquan/data/Agent/RFVIL_output/action1/level1_blocks_1/test\"\nSavetext(savepath=save_path, result=actions_to_save)\n```\n<end_action>\nObservation:\nSave successfully.\nThought: The action has been successfully validated and saved. Now I will return the finalized list of actions for display.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(['A hand picks up the orange cube and then places it into the box.'])\n```\n<end_action>\nFinal answer:\n['A hand picks up the orange cube and then places it into the box.']\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nExample2:\n---------------------------------------\nYou will be given a list of the initial keyframes of a video (parameter key_frames).

I'll verify each of the four actions using the `TemporalVerify` tool. These actions need to be checked for spatial relations with respect to the reference objects:\n1.
